    <a h2>4) Description: For our final project, we worked off of our concept from our previous group project idea. This time we decided to call our video art “Retrospect.” This word describes our video of how our minds can wander simply from one memory, transformed into alternate realities within our dreams.

            Mengshi and Huimin created graphics using Touch Designer and After Effects based on the color scheme of the first clip played in the video. Kyra remixed the audio to work cohesively with the various clips and glitch effects, as well as edit the final video and intro/outro clips.
    
            The background music was by Jon Maultsby, known as “Tashi” on SoundCloud. His authentic and fresh take on new audio and music was perfect for our project and bringing our video together in the end.
    
            Our process started with creating a sketched out timeline, and working off of small doodles as inspiration for our glitch art. After gathering all of these clips Kyra edited them together in a final video compiled with the audio, glitch art, and recorded clips. Mengshi and Huimin created stunning graphics using TouchDesigner and After Effects to expand on our concept of “Retrospect.”
    
            During the video there is a recurring clip that displays the morphing of memories that one may encounter within their dreams. This clip creates unity within the video to support a constant “flow.” The “Tunnels” clips were to act as transitions within our memories during the transformation of “our memories.” In the end the final tunnel clip is the colorful roadway into our inevitable reality, that our alternate realities and dreams always come to an end.
    
            There is an underlying meaning within this video that is not easy to display on screen, but we believe this video embodies the idea of retrospection and the effect it has on our dreams. Our dreams lead to our internal escapes, and this is a reality that only exists within our minds. In this video the memory of a sunset led to an alternate technicolor reality and universe within our minds of glitchy and colorful transformations.</a h2><br><br><br>
