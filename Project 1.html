    <a h2>4) Description: Modern video art has a big different from the traditonal video art. They both affect and even change people’s life. In this video, there are two parts.One is the old TV part, that represents the traditional video art. For the traditional video art part, I didn’t use a lot effect, because I thought that time haven have the effect yet. The another part is the 4K TV screen, it represents the modern video art. For this part, I used a lot video transactions effect in order to look coherent. I used the resources from Adobe Stock, it’s free to download. And also, I learned the In TV Effect from YouTube, it’s helpful. When I saw the old film, they always used these effect, that gave me the idea to get the in TV effect and the green screen effect.</a h2><br><br><br>
