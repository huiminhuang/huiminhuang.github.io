    <a h2>1) Title: Wanderlust</a h2><br><br><br>
    <a h2>2) Date: 09/30/19</a h2><br><br><br>
    <a h2>3) Mediums Description: Recorded video, TouchDesigner, and Premier Pro 1280px720p, Displayed on 49.0” H x 87.2” W Projection Screens</a h2><br><br><br>
    <a h2>4) Description: Our installation proposal called ‘Wanderlust,” is based around the idea of driving with a sunset in view. Mengshi’s video from her first project in VID 75 is a recording of a sunset from the side view of the passenger window in a car. This single clip inspired our entire project/installation proposal. We wanted to create and provide an experience that allowed viewers to see an aesthetically pleasing array of colors in a normal view, kaleidoscope view, and glitch effect view on a “multichannel” setting. Given that this is a proposal, we placed all three clips on one single screen for the sake of time and easier access to playing the movie. 
            The colorful sunset provided unique opportunities to transform the clip into three different versions using TouchDesigner and Premiere Pro. We then placed the three clips horizontally on one single screen in Premiere Pro, which created a “multichannel” effect. If this proposal were to be turned into an installation, each video would be on its own personal mini screen television and played as a real multichannel video in a small room. The vast array of complementary colors from this single clip would provide an “ethereal” mood to the installation and invoke viewers to feel a sense of “Wanderlust.” </a h2><br><br><br>
